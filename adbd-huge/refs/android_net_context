 * A struct to capture context relevant to network operations.
 *
 * Application and DNS netids/marks can differ from one another under certain
 * circumstances, notably when a VPN applies to the given uid&apos;s traffic but the
 * VPN network does not have its own DNS servers explicitly provisioned.
 *
 * The introduction of per-UID routing means the uid is also an essential part
 * of the evaluation context. Its proper uninitialized value is
 * NET_CONTEXT_INVALID_UID.
