 * that can be used to communicate with a named service managed by the
 * emulator.
 *
 * This file descriptor can be used as a standard pipe/socket descriptor.
 *
 * &apos;pipeName&apos; is the name of the emulator service you want to connect to.
 * E.g. &apos;opengles&apos; or &apos;camera&apos;.
 *
 * On success, return a valid file descriptor
 * Returns -1 on error, and errno gives the error code, e.g.:
 *
 *    EINVAL  -&gt; unknown/unsupported pipeName
 *    ENOSYS  -&gt; fast pipes not available in this system.
 *
 * ENOSYS should never happen, except if you&apos;re trying to run within a
 * misconfigured emulator.
 *
 * You should be able to open several pipes to the same pipe service,
 * except for a few special cases (e.g. GSM modem), where EBUSY will be
 * returned if more than one client tries to connect to it.
