 * sparse_file_add_file - associate a chunk of a file with a sparse file
 *
 * @s - sparse file cookie
 * @filename - filename of the file to be copied
 * @file_offset - offset into the copied file
 * @len - length of the copied block
 * @block - offset in blocks into the sparse file to place the file chunk
 *
 * Associates a chunk of an existing file with a sparse file cookie.
 * The region [block * block_size : block * block_size + len) must not already
 * be used in the sparse file. If len is not a multiple of the block size the
 * data will be padded with zeros.
 *
 * Allows adding large amounts of data to a sparse file without needing to keep
 * it all mapped.  File size is limited by available virtual address space,
 * exceptionally large files may need to be added in multiple chunks.
 *
 * Returns 0 on success, negative errno on error.
