 *
 * This structure describes the content of a block in flash
 * that is used for recovery and the bootloader to talk to
 * each other.
 *
 * The command field is updated by linux when it wants to
 * reboot into recovery or to update radio or bootloader firmware.
 * It is also updated by the bootloader when firmware update
 * is complete (to boot into recovery for any final cleanup)
 *
 * The status field is written by the bootloader after the
 * completion of an &quot;update-radio&quot; or &quot;update-hboot&quot; command.
 *
 * The recovery field is only written by linux and used
 * for the system to send a message to recovery or the
 * other way around.
 *
 * The stage field is written by packages which restart themselves
 * multiple times, so that the UI can reflect which invocation of the
 * package it is.  If the value is of the format &quot;#/#&quot; (eg, &quot;1/3&quot;),
 * the UI will add a simple indicator of that status.
 *
 * The slot_suffix field is used for A/B implementations where the
 * bootloader does not set the androidboot.ro.boot.slot_suffix kernel
 * commandline parameter. This is used by fs_mgr to mount /system and
 * other partitions with the slotselect flag set in fstab. A/B
 * implementations are free to use all 32 bytes and may store private
 * data past the first NUL-byte in this field.
