   * which means that they are shared between namespaces - the caller namespace and the new one
   * will use the same copy of a library if it was loaded prior to android_create_namespace call.
   *
   * Note that libraries loaded after the namespace is created will not be shared.
   *
   * Shared namespaces can be isolated or regular. Note that they do not inherit the search path nor
   * permitted_path from the caller&apos;s namespace.
