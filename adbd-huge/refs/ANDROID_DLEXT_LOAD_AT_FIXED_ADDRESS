   *
   * The difference between ANDROID_DLEXT_LOAD_AT_FIXED_ADDRESS and ANDROID_DLEXT_RESERVED_ADDRESS
   * is that for ANDROID_DLEXT_LOAD_AT_FIXED_ADDRESS the linker reserves memory at reserved_addr
   * whereas for ANDROID_DLEXT_RESERVED_ADDRESS the linker relies on the caller to reserve the memory.
   *
   * This flag can be used with ANDROID_DLEXT_FORCE_FIXED_VADDR; when ANDROID_DLEXT_FORCE_FIXED_VADDR
   * is set and load_bias is not 0 (load_bias is min(p_vaddr) of PT_LOAD segments) this flag is ignored.
   * This is implemented this way because the linker has to pick one address over the other and this
   * way is more convenient for art. Note that ANDROID_DLEXT_FORCE_FIXED_VADDR does not generate
   * an error when min(p_vaddr) is 0.
   *
   * Cannot be used with ANDROID_DLEXT_RESERVED_ADDRESS or ANDROID_DLEXT_RESERVED_ADDRESS_HINT.
   *
   * This flag is for ART internal use only.
