   * This flag allows forced loading of the library in the case when for some
   * reason multiple ELF files share the same filename (because the already-loaded
   * library has been removed and overwritten, for example).
   *
   * Note that if the library has the same dt_soname as an old one and some other
   * library has the soname in DT_NEEDED list, the first one will be used to resolve any
   * dependencies.
