 * Creates new linker namespace.
 * ld_library_path and default_library_path represent the search path
 * for the libraries in the namespace.
 *
 * The libraries in the namespace are searched by folowing order:
 * 1. ld_library_path (Think of this as namespace-local LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
 * 2. In directories specified by DT_RUNPATH of the &quot;needed by&quot; binary.
 * 3. deault_library_path (This of this as namespace-local default library path)
 *
 * When type is ANDROID_NAMESPACE_TYPE_ISOLATED the resulting namespace requires all of
 * the libraries to be on the search path or under the permitted_when_isolated_path;
 * the search_path is ld_library_path:default_library_path. Note that the
 * permitted_when_isolated_path path is not part of the search_path and
 * does not affect the search order. It is a way to allow loading libraries from specific
 * locations when using absolute path.
 * If a library or any of its dependencies are outside of the permitted_when_isolated_path
 * and search_path, and it is not part of the public namespace dlopen will fail.
