   * that two asymmetric operations are used, this value applies to the one
   * that controls the confidentiality of the connection. Its interpretation
   * depends on the primitive that was used; as specified by the cipher suite:
   *   DHE: the size, in bits, of the multiplicative group.
   *   RSA: the size, in bits, of the modulus.
   *   ECDHE: the TLS id for the curve.
   *
   * A zero indicates that the value is unknown. */</doc>
