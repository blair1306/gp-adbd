<doc f='codebrowser/bionic/libc/bionic/pthread_key.cpp' l='42'>// pthread_key_internal_t records the use of each pthread key slot:
//   seq records the state of the slot.
//      bit 0 is 1 when the key is in use, 0 when it is unused. Each time we create or delete the
//      pthread key in the slot, we increse the seq by 1 (which inverts bit 0). The reason to use
//      a sequence number instead of a boolean value here is that when the key slot is deleted and
//      reused for a new key, pthread_getspecific will not return stale data.
//   key_destructor records the destructor called at thread exit.</doc>
