 * Historically, a number of APIs were implemented in OpenSSL as macros and
 * constants to &apos;ctrl&apos; functions. To avoid breaking #ifdefs in consumers, this
 * section defines a number of legacy macros.
 *
 * Although using either the CTRL values or their wrapper macros in #ifdefs is
 * still supported, the CTRL values may not be passed to |SSL_ctrl| and
 * |SSL_CTX_ctrl|. Call the functions (previously wrapper macros) instead. */</doc>
