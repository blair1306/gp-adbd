<doc f='codebrowser/external/pcre/config.h' l='175'>/* The above limit applies to all calls of match(), whether or not they
   increase the recursion depth. In some environments it is desirable to limit
   the depth of recursive calls of match() more strictly, in order to restrict
   the maximum amount of stack (or heap, if NO_RECURSE is defined) that is
   used. The value of MATCH_LIMIT_RECURSION applies only to recursive calls of
   match(). To have any useful effect, it must be less than the value of
   MATCH_LIMIT. The default is to use the same value as MATCH_LIMIT. There is
   a runtime method for setting a different limit. */</doc>
