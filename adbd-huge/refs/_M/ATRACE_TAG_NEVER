 * The ATRACE_TAG macro can be defined before including this header to trace
 * using one of the tags defined below.  It must be defined to one of the
 * following ATRACE_TAG_* macros.  The trace tag is used to filter tracing in
 * userland to avoid some of the runtime cost of tracing when it is not desired.
 *
 * Defining ATRACE_TAG to be ATRACE_TAG_ALWAYS will result in the tracing always
 * being enabled - this should ONLY be done for debug code, as userland tracing
 * has a performance cost even when the trace is not being recorded.  Defining
 * ATRACE_TAG to be ATRACE_TAG_NEVER or leaving ATRACE_TAG undefined will result
 * in the tracing always being disabled.
 *
 * ATRACE_TAG_HAL should be bitwise ORed with the relevant tags for tracing
 * within a hardware module.  For example a camera hardware module would set:
 * #define ATRACE_TAG  (ATRACE_TAG_CAMERA | ATRACE_TAG_HAL)
 *
 * Keep these in sync with frameworks/base/core/java/android/os/Trace.java.
