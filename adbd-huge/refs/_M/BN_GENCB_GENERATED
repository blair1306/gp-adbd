<doc f='codebrowser/external/boringssl/src/include/openssl/bn.h' l='602'>/* BN_GENCB holds a callback function that is used by generation functions that
 * can take a very long time to complete. Use |BN_GENCB_set| to initialise a
 * |BN_GENCB| structure.
 *
 * The callback receives the address of that |BN_GENCB| structure as its last
 * argument and the user is free to put an arbitary pointer in |arg|. The other
 * arguments are set as follows:
 *   event=BN_GENCB_GENERATED, n=i:   after generating the i&apos;th possible prime
 *                                    number.
 *   event=BN_GENCB_PRIME_TEST, n=-1: when finished trial division primality
 *                                    checks.
 *   event=BN_GENCB_PRIME_TEST, n=i:  when the i&apos;th primality test has finished.
 *
 * The callback can return zero to abort the generation progress or one to
 * allow it to continue.
 *
 * When other code needs to call a BN generation function it will often take a
 * BN_GENCB argument and may call the function with other argument values. */</doc>
