<doc f='codebrowser/external/pcre/dist/pcre_internal.h' l='2186'>/* This macro defines the length of fixed length operations in the compiled
regex. The lengths are used when searching for specific things, and also in the
debugging printing of a compiled regex. We use a macro so that it can be
defined close to the definitions of the opcodes themselves.

As things have been extended, some of these are no longer fixed lenths, but are
minima instead. For example, the length of a single-character repeat may vary
in UTF-8 mode. The code that uses this table must know about such things. */</doc>
