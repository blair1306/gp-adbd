<doc f='codebrowser/external/pcre/dist/pcre_internal.h' l='585'>/* There is a proposed future special &quot;UTF-21&quot; mode, in which only the lowest
21 bits of a 32-bit character are interpreted as UTF, with the remaining 11
high-order bits available to the application for other uses. In preparation for
the future implementation of this mode, there are macros that load a data item
and, if in this special mode, mask it to 21 bits. These macros all have names
starting with UCHAR21. In all other modes, including the normal 32-bit
library, the macros all have the same simple definitions. When the new mode is
implemented, it is expected that these definitions will be varied appropriately
using #ifdef when compiling the library that supports the special mode. */</doc>
