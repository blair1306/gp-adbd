<doc f='codebrowser/external/pcre/config.h' l='280'>/* When calling PCRE via the POSIX interface, additional working storage is
   required for holding the pointers to capturing substrings because PCRE
   requires three integers per substring, whereas the POSIX interface provides
   only two. If the number of expected substrings is small, the wrapper
   function uses space on the stack, because this is faster than using
   malloc() for each call. The threshold above which the stack is no longer
   used is defined by POSIX_MALLOC_THRESHOLD. */</doc>
