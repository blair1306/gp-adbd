<doc f='codebrowser/external/pcre/config.h' l='195'>/* The value of NEWLINE determines the default newline character sequence.
   PCRE client programs can override this by selecting other values at run
   time. In ASCII environments, the value can be 10 (LF), 13 (CR), or 3338
   (CRLF); in EBCDIC environments the value can be 21 or 37 (LF), 13 (CR), or
   3349 or 3365 (CRLF) because there are two alternative codepoints (0x15 and
   0x25) that are used as the NL line terminator that is equivalent to ASCII
   LF. In both ASCII and EBCDIC environments the value can also be -1 (ANY),
   or -2 (ANYCRLF). */</doc>
