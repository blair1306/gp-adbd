<doc f='codebrowser/system/core/fs_mgr/fs_mgr_priv.h' l='33'>/* fstab has the following format:
 *
 * Any line starting with a # is a comment and ignored
 *
 * Any blank line is ignored
 *
 * All other lines must be in this format:
 *   &lt;source&gt;  &lt;mount_point&gt; &lt;fs_type&gt; &lt;mount_flags&gt; &lt;fs_options&gt; &lt;fs_mgr_options&gt;
 *
 *   &lt;mount_flags&gt; is a comma separated list of flags that can be passed to the
 *                 mount command.  The list includes noatime, nosuid, nodev, nodiratime,
 *                 ro, rw, remount, defaults.
 *
 *   &lt;fs_options&gt; is a comma separated list of options accepted by the filesystem being
 *                mounted.  It is passed directly to mount without being parsed
 *
 *   &lt;fs_mgr_options&gt; is a comma separated list of flags that control the operation of
 *                     the fs_mgr program.  The list includes &quot;wait&quot;, which will wait till
 *                     the &lt;source&gt; file exists, and &quot;check&quot;, which requests that the fs_mgr 
 *                     run an fscheck program on the &lt;source&gt; before mounting the filesystem.
 *                     If check is specifed on a read-only filesystem, it is ignored.
 *                     Also, &quot;encryptable&quot; means that filesystem can be encrypted.
 *                     The &quot;encryptable&quot; flag _MUST_ be followed by a = and a string which
 *                     is the location of the encryption keys.  It can either be a path
 *                     to a file or partition which contains the keys, or the word &quot;footer&quot;
 *                     which means the keys are in the last 16 Kbytes of the partition
 *                     containing the filesystem.
 *
 * When the fs_mgr is requested to mount all filesystems, it will first mount all the
 * filesystems that do _NOT_ specify check (including filesystems that are read-only and
 * specify check, because check is ignored in that case) and then it will check and mount
 * filesystem marked with check.
