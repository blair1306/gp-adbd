   internal match() function can be called during a single execution of
   pcre_exec(). There is a runtime interface for setting a different limit.
   The limit exists in order to catch runaway regular expressions that take
   for ever to determine that they do not match. The default is set very large
   so that it does not accidentally catch legitimate cases. */</doc>
