 * setstate:
 *
 * Restore the state from the given state array.
 *
 * Note: it is important that we also remember the locations of the pointers
 * in the current state information, and restore the locations of the pointers
 * from the old state information.  This is done by multiplexing the pointer
 * location into the zeroeth word of the state information.
 *
 * Note that due to the order in which things are done, it is OK to call
 * setstate() with the same state as the current state.
 *
 * Returns a pointer to the old state information.
 *
 * Note: The Sparc platform requires that arg_state begin on a long
 * word boundary; otherwise a bus error will occur. Even so, lint will
 * complain about mis-alignment, but you should disregard these messages.
