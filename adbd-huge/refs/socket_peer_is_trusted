 * socket_peer_is_trusted - Takes a socket which is presumed to be a
 * connected local socket (e.g. AF_LOCAL) and returns whether the peer
 * (the userid that owns the process on the other end of that socket)
 * is one of the two trusted userids, root or shell.
 *
 * Note: This only works as advertised on the Android OS and always
 * just returns true when called on other operating systems.
